Introduction
The Plant Disease Detection project is a web-based application designed to help users detect diseases in plants by uploading images. This application uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify the disease and provides detailed information on the disease, including preventive measures and supplement recommendations.

Features
Image Upload: Users can upload an image of a plant leaf to detect any potential disease.
Disease Detection: The CNN model analyzes the uploaded image and identifies the disease.
Detailed Information: Users receive a detailed description of the disease, along with preventive measures.
Supplement Recommendations: The application suggests relevant supplements for disease management and provides a direct link to purchase them online.
Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
